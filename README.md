## First steps

Your first stop should be the templates [[templates/_index|_index]] folder. Be sure to read the [[templates/README|README]] in templates to give you some guidance on how to use and expand this space.

Next, perhaps you should choose a guide from the guides folder [[guides/_index|_index]], but it may also be wise to stop over at the reference sheet folder [[reference-sheets/_index|_index]], although the guides will make reference to where reference sheets are relevant.
