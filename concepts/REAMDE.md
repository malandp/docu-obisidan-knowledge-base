# Concepts
The `concepts` folder is intended to house folders and files to inform the user of the why, and not so much the how.
How will be managed by folders like `guides`: [[guides/README|README]] and `reference-sheets`: [[reference-sheets/README|README]]

In general, `folders` and `files` in the `concepts` folder should have sister files in the `reference-sheets`: [[reference-sheets/README|README]] folder
