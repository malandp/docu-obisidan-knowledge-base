# Templates overview
This folder stores a collection of templates, tips and how to use and expand this space.

## Formatting tips
Several files that includes tips and lookup reference sheets for writing and formatting `md` files are presented as follows:


## Organisation
You'll notice that the knowledge base space is organised into folders, generally each with an `_index` and `README` file
### \_index
`_index` files are intended to give the user a quick navigation overview of the current folder. Use it to aid you in navigation. `_index` files may link to deeper nested `_index` files, or simply to `md` files within the folder
### README
`README` files are intended to give an overview of the contents of a folder. Use it for a quick summary of what you can learn from any given folder.
### Folder structure
Besides `_index` and `README` files, each `folder` may contain deeper nested `folders`, or `md` files containing raw, unfiltered knowledge. Readers must take care to open their third eyes to peer into the arcane knowledge contained within, but do not stare too deeply less the knowledge gleams something untoward about you.
> [!important]
> Always include an `_index` and `README` file in your folder!

### File and folder numbering
`folders` and `md` files in spaces are generally prepended with a number, indicating the order in which the folder is intended to be followed, for example `42-a-cool-folder` or `69-just-do-it.md`. You don't have to follow the intended order of execution, but it is recommended, especially when first starting out.

`folders` and `files` do not HAVE to be numbered! If you create a folder and do not intend for it to have any hierarchical or indexed structure, you do not need to prepend with `xx-`
> [!attention]
> Folders do not HAVE to be prepended with a number in the format `00-`, but it sure does help to create a sense of hierarchy and order!

`md` files and `folders` are generally numbered separately, i.e. there may be a folder that starts with `00-` and a `md` file that starts with `00-` the reason for this is simply because `folders` will be shown first, and `md` files second in the file browser, so there is no point in mixing up the numbering.
> [!tip]
> Prepend `folders` and `files` with an index number to help organize folders and create a sense of direction, for example `42-a-cool-folder`  or `69-just-do-it.md`

The order of numbering generally starts from 2 places. `items` starting at `00` and counting up generally indicate where you should start, while items starting at `99` and counting down are generally items that can be done at any time and do not need to follow an ordering.

> [!faq]
> `folder` / `file` numbering can start from `00-` and count up (for indexed steps) or `99-` and count down for un-indexed steps

## Templates
Now that you FULLY understand how this space is structured, you can start adding more information.

Templates are made available for `_index` and `README` files below:
